Hi there! I am Feiyang, you can also call me Vance. I am an incoming CS graduate student at <a href ="http://www.ucla.edu/">UCLA</a>. Currently, I’m working as an R&D intern at <a href ="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>. My research interest focuses on Multimodal Machine Learning and Healthcare/Bio-medicine. Here is my <a href ="https://drive.google.com/file/d/17FVP06vmCIJY5lyZaW320CsTX3E3zU15/view?usp=sharing">Résumé</a> and <a href ="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mhUhs0zsHJDd17No6GUMkcK4p_y36E2c/view?usp=sharing">Research Statement</a>. If you are interested in me or looking for potential collaborators, please don’t hesitate to <a href="mailto: fychen@ucla.edu">contact me</a>!

My research topic lies widely in the scope of Multimodal Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and Audio Signal Processing. I have been pondering how machines can break out of their computational boundaries to understand human intelligence. As the nature of human communication is Multimodal, I aspire to get computers to reach new heights in their understanding.
