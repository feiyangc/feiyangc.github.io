Hi there! I am Feiyang, you can also call me Vance. I'm a first-year CS graduate student at <a href ="http://www.ucla.edu/">UCLA</a>. My current research interest focuses on multimodal machine learning and healthcare/bio-medicine. As the nature of human communication is multimodal, I aspire to get computers to reach new heights in their understanding and open up new avenues for AI in healthcare. I'm always open to collaborations on Multimodal and Interdisciplinary research topics, feel free to <a href="mailto: fychen@ucla.edu">contact me</a>!

I have been pondering how machines can break out of their computational boundaries to understand human intelligence. My goal is to develop computationally efficient machine learning as well as deep learning models and algorithms, building the computational foundations to enable computers with the abilities to analyze, recognize and predict subtle human communicative behaviors during social interactions. Applications include computer vision, natural language processing, audio signal processing, and drug discovery.


<p>My research interests include: <br> <a href ="https://github.com/Eurus-Holmes/Awesome-Multimodal-Research">Multimodal Machine Learning</a>: representation, alignment, translation, fusion, and co-learning of heterogeneous data <br> <a href ="https://github.com/eugeneyan/applied-ml">Applied Machine Learning</a>: real-world applications in language, vision, speech, robotics, education, and self-driving <br> <a href ="https://plusx.ai/">AI + X</a>: AI for healthcare, finance, climate, agriculture, astronomy, art, and VR
